# Python 3.10 alpha 0

*Python 3.10 alpha 0* with *PEP 622* implementation. This is good start, if you would like to test Python with *Structural Pattern Matching* using *match* and *case* keywords. Once Python 3.10 is officially published, this build will become obsolete and whould not be used in production. Anyway, do not use this version in production.
